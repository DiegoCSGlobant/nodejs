## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows you to run JavaScript on your server.

## Installation and Setup

Node.js can be installed from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). After installing Node.js, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

## Understanding Node.js Modules
In Node.js, modules are a set of functions that you want to include in your application. To include a module, use the `require()` function with the name of the module:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
```
## Asynchronous Programming
One of the key features of Node.js is its asynchronous, event-driven architecture. This means that operations don't have to wait for other operations to complete before they start.

```javascript
fs.readFile('input.txt', function(err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);
   console.log(data.toString());
});
console.log('Program Ended');
```

In the example above, the program doesn't wait for file reading and proceeds to print "Program Ended".

## Handling Errors
Node.js uses exceptions to handle errors. These exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks.

Node.js with Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. To install Express, you can use npm (Node.js package manager):

```bash
npm install express
```

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
That's it! Now you have a basic understanding of Node.js, its core concepts, and how to use it with Express.

Happy Coding!
